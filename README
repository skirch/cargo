= cargo

cargo is an Active Record extension that provides a basic way to save file
data along side an Active Record object. For example, if you have an image model
and need to save image data outside of your database, cargo can help.

== Getting Started

=== Installation

  $ gem install cargo --source http://code.yieldself.com/

=== Setup

Before you use cargo, you need to set <tt>Cargo.config.file_path</tt> so it
knows where to save files. This is normally done in Rails' environment.rb.

  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    config.gem 'cargo', :source => 'http://code.yieldself.com'
  end

  Cargo.config.file_path = '/var/files'

Create a migration for the table that will store file metadata. The table is
called <tt>external_files</tt> by default, but you can change the name via
<tt>Cargo.config.table_name</tt>.

  $ script/generate migration CreateExternalFiles

Edit the migration to create the required table and columns.

  class CreateExternalFiles < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :external_files do |t|
        t.integer :parent_id
        t.string :parent_type
        t.string :extension
        t.string :key
        t.timestamps
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :external_files
    end
  end

Run the migration.

 $ rake db:migrate

=== Example

  class Image < ActiveRecord::Base
    cargo :file
  end

When you create a new Image object, cargo will provide you with an easy way
to save the image file.

  @image = Image.new
  @image.set_file('path/to/file.jpg')
  @image.save

Access the image file like so:

  @image.file.filename
  # => "00_00_01_4b2xu3.jpg"

  @image.file.absolute_filename
  # => "/var/files/images/00/00/00_00_01_4b2xu3.jpg"

Filenames are created automatically. cargo takes care of naming files and
limits the maximum number of files per directory. Files are deleted when
objects are destroyed.
